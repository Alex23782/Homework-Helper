# 3D Drift Game

A simple 3D car drift game built with Three.js. Drive a car around a flat track using basic keyboard controls (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`).

## Features:
- 3D car and flat ground with a simple drifting effect.
- Simple physics for acceleration, turning, and friction.
- Mobile-friendly (works well on touchscreens, i.e., iPad).

## Controls:
- **W**: Accelerate
- **A**: Turn Left
- **S**: Reverse
- **D**: Turn Right
